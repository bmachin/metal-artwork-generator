# metal-artwork-generator
I collected heavy metal albums artwork in this [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/benjamnmachn/metal-albums-artwork) 
and then trained [StyleGAN2-ADA](https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan2-ada) with a subset of it.

You can generate your own artwork using the notebook in Colab. I will keep training this model and also train more models in specific subgenres.

I also wrote a [Medium article](https://medium.com/@machin.benjamin/training-a-heavy-metal-artwork-generator-using-stylegan2-ada-1c1e30bc1e9b) if you want to learn more.
